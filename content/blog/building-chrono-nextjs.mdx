# Building Chrono: A Time Tracking SaaS with Next.js 16

Chrono is a time tracking and project management platform I built for small teams. It won the People's Choice Award at Google Cloud Developers 2025. Here's the story behind its development.

## The Motivation

Existing time tracking tools were either too simple (lacking project management) or too complex (enterprise bloat). I wanted to build something that struck the right balance for small teams.

## Tech Stack Highlights

- **Next.js 16** - Latest App Router features
- **React 19** - New hooks and improvements
- **TypeScript** - Type safety throughout
- **SQLite** - Simple, reliable data storage
- **Tailwind CSS** - Rapid UI development
- **Resend** - Transactional emails
- **Google Gemini** - AI-powered analytics

## Key Features

### 1. Weekly Timesheets

Intuitive time entry with:
- Drag-and-drop time blocks
- Project/task categorization
- Automatic overtime calculations
- Export to PDF/CSV

### 2. Kanban Project Boards

Visual project management:
- Customizable columns
- Drag-and-drop tasks
- Time estimates vs. actuals
- Team assignments

### 3. Role-Based Team Management

Flexible permissions:
- Admin, Manager, and Member roles
- Project-specific access control
- Time approval workflows
- Team analytics dashboards

### 4. AI-Powered Analytics

Using Google Gemini for insights:
- Productivity pattern analysis
- Time allocation recommendations
- Burnout risk detection
- Project health scoring

## Technical Implementation

### Server Actions

```typescript
// Example server action for time entry
'use server'

export async function createTimeEntry(data: TimeEntryInput) {
  const session = await getSession()
  if (!session) throw new Error('Unauthorized')
  
  const entry = await db.insert(timeEntries).values({
    ...data,
    userId: session.user.id,
    createdAt: new Date(),
  }).returning()
  
  revalidatePath('/dashboard')
  return entry
}
```

### Database Schema

SQLite with a simple but effective schema:
- Users and teams
- Projects and tasks
- Time entries
- Analytics snapshots

### AI Integration

```typescript
// Gemini-powered productivity insights
export async function generateInsights(userId: string) {
  const timeData = await getUserTimeData(userId)
  
  const prompt = `Analyze this time tracking data and provide insights:
  ${JSON.stringify(timeData)}
  
  Focus on:
  1. Productivity patterns
  2. Time allocation recommendations
  3. Potential burnout indicators`
  
  const result = await gemini.generateContent(prompt)
  return parseInsights(result.response.text())
}
```

## Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Real-time Updates

**Challenge**: Multiple users editing simultaneously
**Solution**: Optimistic UI updates with conflict resolution

### 2. Mobile Responsiveness

**Challenge**: Complex Kanban boards on small screens
**Solution**: Adaptive layouts, swipe gestures, simplified mobile views

### 3. Email Deliverability

**Challenge**: Getting emails to inbox, not spam
**Solution**: Resend with proper SPF/DKIM setup

## The Award

Chrono won the **People's Choice of the Year 2025** at Google Cloud Developers for its innovative AI Voice Agent feature that automates insurance quoting via phone calls.

The project demonstrates how modern web technologies can create powerful, user-friendly business tools.

## What's Next?

- Mobile app (React Native)
- Calendar integrations (Google, Outlook)
- Advanced reporting
- Team scheduling
- API for integrations

Building Chrono was an incredible learning experience, reinforcing the power of the modern React ecosystem and AI integration.
